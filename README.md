### About

Built as an exercise to learn about Android graphics, playing tones and sharing multimedia content in text format.
Including:
- Playing 16-bit tones
- Rendering graphics
- Sending SMS messages
- Intercepting incoming messages
- Saving and retrieving data
- Testing and input validation

...It has no real-life applications, but was a fun learning experience.
