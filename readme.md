

A fully-functional native Android app, which takes musical notes, plays them, and
can preview the music on a stave as well as send them via SMS to another mobile number.

I made this app as a learning exercise at University, to practice using Android
graphics, playing tones and sharing multimedia content in text format. I am well
aware that there is no real-life use for an app like this, it is pointless!
But it was fun to make, and I learnt lots of new stuff in the process ðŸ˜„
Posting the source code on here on the off-chance that anyone else finds any
part of it vaguely useful - enjoy!
